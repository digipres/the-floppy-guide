The Floppy Guide (TBC) 
======================

As part of the [Future Nostalgia project](https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/future-nostalgia), we are putting together a guide on preserving floppy disks. The guide is currently in the reviewing stage. The draft version of the guide can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZfPaXMOXCphfnDKKRoImzccHtY2M2hBZLI5mP65RNpk/edit?usp=sharing). You will be able to leave any comments or suggestions.
